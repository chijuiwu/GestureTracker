# GestureTracker
Gesture recognition and tracking, based on [Kinect2Kit](https://github.com/cjw-charleswu/Kinect2Kit).

Using multiple Kinects via Kinect2Kit, we can track people's positions and their gestures reliably, even through occlusion.

    - `(venv) $ python run.py --host=[host] --port=[port]`

2. Run the Kinect clients
